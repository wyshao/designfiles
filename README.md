The design files for the paper submission "Graded Index Fiber-Inspired 3-D Printed Surface Focusing Porous Dielectric Structure with GaAs MMIC Rectenna for High-Efficient Millimeter-Wave Wireless Power Transfer"
Specifically,
1."Slice_file.3mf"
 Slice file (.3mf) of proposed structure with different filling ratio in Section II(A)
 
2. "plano-convex hyperbolic lens.stl"
3D CAD model file (.stl) of designed plano-convex hyperbolic lens in Section II(C)

Usage:

1."Slice_file.3mf"
To open this project file, the open-source Ultimaker Cura 3-D slicing software is required. Some parameter settings are related to the model of 3-D printer .In our case, the "UltiMaker S3" 3d printer is ultilized to fabricate the designed structure.

2. "plano-convex hyperbolic lens.stl"
The designed plano-convex hyperbolic lens  has a diameter of 80 mm and focal length of 56 mm. 
This lens model file can be directly imported into the Ultimaker Cura 3-D slicing software. Noted that the infill ratio needs to be set to 100% for fabricating this lens.
